}
\arguments{
\item{GDINA.obj}{An estimated model object of class \code{GDINA}}

\item{method}{method for item level model comparison; can be \code{wald}, \code{LR} or \code{LM}.}

\item{items}{a vector of items to specify the items for model comparsion}

\item{p.adjust.methods}{adjusted p-values for multiple hypothesis tests. This is conducted using \code{p.adjust} function in \pkg{stats},
and therefore all adjustment methods supported by \code{p.adjust} can be used, including \code{"holm"},
\code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"}, \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"} and \code{"BY"}. See \code{p.adjust}
for more details. \code{"holm"} is the default, indicating the Holm method.}

\item{models}{a vector specifying which reduced CDMs are possible reduced CDMs for each
item. The default is "DINA","DINO","ACDM","LLM",and "RRUM".}

\item{decision.args}{a list of options for determining the most appropriate models including (1) \code{rule} can be
either \code{"simpler"} or \code{"largestp"}. See details;
(2) \code{alpha.level} for the nominal level of decision; and (3) \code{adjusted} can be either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}
indicating whether the decision is based on p value (\code{adjusted = FALSE}) or adjusted p values.}

\item{DS}{whether dissimilarity index should be calculated? \code{FALSE} is the default.}

\item{Wald.args}{a list of options for Wald test including (1) \code{SE.type} giving the type of
covariance matrix for the Wald test; by default, it uses outer product of gradient based on incomplete information matrix;
(2) \code{varcov} for user specified variance-covariance matrix. If supplied, it must
be a list, giving the variance covariance matrix of success probability for each item or category.
The default is \code{NULL}, in which case, the estimated variance-covariance matrix from the GDINA function
is used.}

\item{LR.args}{a list of options for LR test including for now only \code{LR.approx}, which is either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE},
indicating whether a two-step LR approximation is implemented or not.}

\item{LM.args}{a list of options for LM test including \code{reducedMDINA}, \code{reducedMDINO}, and \code{reducedMACDM} for
DINA, DINO and ACDM estimates from the \code{GDINA} function; \code{SE.type} specifies the type of covariance matrix.}

\item{object}{object of class \code{modelcomp} for various S3 methods}

\item{what}{argument for S3 method \code{extract} indicating what to extract;
It can be \code{"wald"} for wald statistics, \code{"wald.p"} for associated p-values,
\code{"df"} for degrees of freedom,
and \code{"DS"} for dissimilarity between G-DINA and other CDMs.}

\item{digits}{How many decimal places in each number? The default is 4.}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{modelcomp}. Elements that can be
extracted using \code{extract} method include
\describe{
\item{stats}{Wald or LR statistics}
\item{pvalues}{p-values associated with the test statistics}
\item{adj.pvalues}{adjusted p-values}
\item{df}{degrees of freedom}
\item{DS}{dissimilarity between G-DINA and other CDMs}
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether the saturated G-DINA model can be replaced by reduced
CDMs without significant loss in model data fit for each item using the Wald test, likelihood ratio (LR) test or Lagrange multiplier (LM) test.
For Wald test, see de la Torre (2011), de la Torre and Lee (2013), Ma, Iaconangelo and de la Torre (2016) and Ma & de la Torre (2018) for details.
For LR test and a two-step LR approximation procedure, see Sorrel, de la Torre, Abad, and Olea (2017), Ma (2017) and Ma & de la Torre (2019).
For LM test, which is only applicable for DINA, DINO and ACDM, see Sorrel, Abad, Olea, de la Torre, and Barrada (2017).
This function also calculates the dissimilarity
between the reduced models and the G-DINA model, which can be viewed as a measure of effect size (Ma, Iaconangelo & de la Torre, 2016).
}
\details{
After the test statistics for each reduced CDM were calculated for each item, the
reduced models with p values less than the pre-specified alpha level were rejected.
If all reduced models were rejected for an item, the G-DINA model was used as the best model;
if at least one reduced model was retained, two diferent rules can be implemented for selecting
the best model specified in argument \code{decision.args}:

(1) when \code{rule="simpler"},

 If (a) the DINA or DINO model
 was one of the retained models, then the DINA or DINO model with the larger p
 value was selected as the best model; but if (b) both DINA and DINO were rejected, the reduced
 model with the largest p value was selected as the best model for this item. Note that
 when the p-values of several reduced models were greater than 0.05, the DINA and DINO models were
 preferred over the A-CDM, LLM, and R-RUM because of their simplicity.

 (2) When \code{rule="largestp"} (default),

 The reduced model with the largest p-values is selected as the most appropriate model.
